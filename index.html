<h4>Listening music</h4>

<p>
    My favorite activity is to listen to <b> music</b>, especially when I am in good mood and when I am so much into a work that requires lots of concentration.
    It really <b>relaxes</b> me and gives me a wonderful feeling to carry out the task whatever I am in such a smooth and easy manner.
